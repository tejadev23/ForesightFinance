📈 Stock Price Prediction using Machine Learning  

🔍 **AI-driven Stock Market Analysis** | **Predicting Stock Trends with ML**  

This project builds a **Stock Price Prediction Model** using **Machine Learning** to forecast stock trends based on historical market data. The model utilizes **time-series analysis and regression techniques** to predict future prices.  

## 🚀 Features  
✔️ Uses **historical stock data** for trend prediction  
✔️ Implements **ML algorithms like LSTM, Random Forest, and Linear Regression**  
✔️ Interactive **frontend for data visualization**  
✔️ Supports **real-time predictions** for better decision-making  

## 📂 Dataset  
The dataset is sourced from **Yahoo Finance/Quandl** and includes **Open, High, Low, Close, and Volume** data.  

## 🛠️ Tech Stack  
- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Matplotlib)  
- **Machine Learning** (LSTM, Random Forest, Linear Regression)  
- **Data Visualization** (Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly)  
- **Frontend** (Flask, React.js)
